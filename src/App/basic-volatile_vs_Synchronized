synchronized is method level/block level access restriction modifier. It will make sure that one thread owns the lock for critical section.
Only the thread,which own a lock can enter synchronized block. If other threads are trying to access this critical section, they have to wait till current owner releases the lock.

volatile is variable access modifier which forces all threads to get latest value of the variable from main memory.
No locking is required to access volatile variables. All threads can access volatile variable value at same time.
