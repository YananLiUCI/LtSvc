bq，项目不能按时完成，怎么办



As a software developer, I usually follow with PM closely for the schedule. If I realized I’m not able to follow the schedule,
 I will investigate the whole project schedule with the PM to see if this schedule is reasonable immediately.

Depends on what situation, if it is absolutely needed to complete all sub-tasks before the deadline.
I’ll ask for help from my colleagues, manager or the program manager to allocate more resource. And I will also work harder meet the schedule.

If some sub-tasks deadline could be postponed, I will deliver the P0 features before the deadline and other features I can develop through later SW updates.
