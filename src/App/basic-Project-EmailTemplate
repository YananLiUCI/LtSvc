Since last year, Ebay provided buyer the option to purchase international shipping service. Our end user encountered very high failure rate, ~ 20%,  purchasing the shipping service.
Failure can due to payment not accepted by shipping department, country regulation. etc. Buyers are likely give up after few times retry, this is harmful for our business.

To improve user experience, I took the lead developed a failure detection mechanism. Whenever user encountered a shipping payment failure, email will send out guiding buyer to make the payment successfully.
This helped user able to figure out the best approach to make successful postage payment immediately they received the email. Previously 43% user retried after first time postage payment failed.
The number increased to 85 % after the launch of this service.
