he Mutex is a locking mechanism that makes sure only one thread can acquire the Mutex at a time and enter the critical section.
This thread only releases the Mutex when it exits the critical section.
Semaphore
A semaphore is a signalling mechanism and a thread that is waiting on a semaphore can be signaled by another thread.
This is different than a mutex as the mutex can be signaled only by the thread that called the wait function.
SpinLock
Say a resource is protected by a lock ,a thread that wants access to the resource needs to acquire the lock first.
If the lock is not available, the thread might repeatedly check if the lock has been freed.
During this time the thread busy waits, checking for the lock, using CPU, but not doing any useful work. Such a lock is termed as a spin lock.
