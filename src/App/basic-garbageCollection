Java garbage collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management. Java programs compile to bytecode that can be run on a Java Virtual Machine, or JVM for short.
When Java programs run on the JVM, objects are created on the heap. As long as an object is being referenced, the JVM considers it alive.
Once an object is no longer referenced and therefore is not reachable by the application code, the garbage collector removes it and reclaims the unused memory.
Which algorithm is used for garbage collection in Java?
The GC in the old generation uses an algorithm called "mark-sweep-compact." The first step of this algorithm is to mark the surviving objects in the old generation.
Then, it checks the heap from the front and leaves only the surviving ones behind (sweep)
It will automatically run can use follow method to
Using System.gc() method : System class contain static method gc() for requesting JVM to run Garbage Collector.
Using Runtime.getRuntime().gc() method : Runtime class allows the application to interface with the JVM in which the application is running.
