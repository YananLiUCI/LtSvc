• Built a recommendation system to recommend movies to users they may like most based on their past rating history
• Used 1GB of Netflix reviews as the dataset and developed a Collaborative Filtering Algorithm (Item-Based) to build concurrent
matrix.
• Based on Collaborative Filtering Algorithm (Item-Based), get the rating matrix from 1GB Netflix reviews, calculate the movies
concurrent matrix, and generate the recommendation lists through matrix multiplication.
• Implemented 4 map reduce job to complete concurrent matrix building, matrix normalization, matrix multiplication,
matrix summation process.

Recommendation System.
Systems that attempt to predict item that users may be interested in or help people find information that may interest them

Algorithm

1User Collaborative Filtering (User CF)


A form of collaborative filtering based on the similarity between users

calculated using people's ratings of those items

2 Item Collaborative Filtering (Item CF)


A form of collaborative filtering based on the similarity between items

calculated using people's ratings of those items

We will use Item CF

●  The number of users weighs more than number of products

●  Item will not change frequently, lowering calculation

●  Using user’s historical data, more convincing

How to do Item CF:
Build co-occurrence matrix（If one user rated two movies, these two are related）
●  Build rating matrix
●  Matrix computation to get recommending result
