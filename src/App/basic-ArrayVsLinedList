The major difference between Array and Linked list regards to their structure.
Arrays are index based data structure where each element associated with an index.
On the other hand, Linked list relies on references where each node consists of the data and the references to the previous and next element
So Linked list provides the following two advantages over arrays
1) Dynamic size
2) Ease of insertion/deletion

Linked lists have following drawbacks:
1) Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do a binary search with linked lists.
2) Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
3) Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.
