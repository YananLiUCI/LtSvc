In our software system, we use data collection module to collect performance data for millions device.
To save cost,  we want to deliver multi threading data collection solution to replace the previous single threading solution.
By using the new solution we can save ~ 50% controllers which is a huge saving for the company.
To implement, we modified the architecture to support multi-threading method and vendor promise their firmware access is thread-safe .
But in the middle of the project, we find some component in vendor software is not accessible by multi-threads.
At that time the DDL is coming and we cannot wait for vendor's fix solution.
I discussed with a team and proposed work around solution, synchronized all threads and only use single thread access to the problematic part.
And after the vendor fix their component, we did a SW update resolved the problem.
