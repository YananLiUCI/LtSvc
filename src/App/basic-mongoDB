Document Databases: In these databases, data is stored in documents (instead of rows and columns in a table) and these documents are grouped together in collections.
Each document can have an entirely different structure. Document databases include the CouchDB and MongoDB.
Storing large volumes of data that often have little to no structure. A NoSQL database sets no limits on the types of data we can store together and allows us to add new types as the need changes.
With document-based databases, you can store data in one place without having to define what “types” of data those are in advance.
