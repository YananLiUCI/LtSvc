PageRank is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results.

old rank method:
Use Title/ Use keyword density /Manually

disadvantage

Not accurate/Easily manipulated by human

Page Rank theory:

1.number assumption : More important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites

2.weighting assumtion:Website with higher PageRank will pass higher weight

We have an initail page rank0 matrix to represent the weight for each website and a transition matrix to represent the relation ship between website.

page rank 1 matrix can be calculated by page rank 0 multiply the transition matrix.

page rank n = page rank (n - 1) * transition matrix.

We can use 2 map reduce job to calculate the transition matrix and do matrix multiplication. 2 map reduce to calculate the sum of the matrix multiplication.

The page rank n will converge and we got the website page ranking.
